As a user, you can be part of an organization with projects, or be a staff member in a project. In projects, you create new packages, or subscribe to existing packages, which contain at last one service or Builder module. The projects use clients to access the services. Use the Service SDK to create services, and use the Builder SDK to create Builder modules, which are displayed in the Builder application. If you create a new package, you can publish it to the YaaS Market so others can subscribe to it.
