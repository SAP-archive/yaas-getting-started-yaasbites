The intended audience for these **Getting Started Guides** is developers who want to quickly learn how to build solutions with YaaS. The guides have two main sections:

#### YaaS Bites
Learn and explore the basic YaaS landscape with the <strong>YaaS Bites Overview</strong>, then take your <strong>YaaS Bites First Steps</strong> and also learn the <strong>YaaS Bites Essentials</strong>. The <strong>YaaS Bites Sequel</strong> describes YaaS solutions in languages beyond Java, including Scala and Akka.

#### Wishlist Tutorial
Use the YaaS <a target="_blank" href="https://devportal.yaas.io/tools/servicesdk/index.html">Service SDK</a> in this section to create your own sample Wishlist service and Builder module, then integrate that service into a cloned storefront.

The prerequisites for following these guides are:

* A basic understanding of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/">Java</a>
* A <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/">Java Development Kit (JDK)</a> version 8 (1.8), available from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Oracle JDK</a> or <a target="_blank" href="http://openjdk.java.net/">OpenJDK</a>
* <a target="_blank" href="http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi">Maven</a> version 3.0.
* <a target="_blank" href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git" >Git</a> to clone the examples
* <a target="_blank" href="https://eclipse.org/downloads/" >Eclipse IDE</a> or a similar development environment
* The layout of the guides are best viewed on large screens
