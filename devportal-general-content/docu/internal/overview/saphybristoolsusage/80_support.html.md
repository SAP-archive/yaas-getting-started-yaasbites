### Get Help for confidential inquiries

For subscribers that are member of a commercial project we offer a more confidential channel to get into contact with us in case of inquiries. In addition to the feedback button these users get a help button where they can fill in their inquiries:
- Customers raise an inquiry via the help button on YaaS.io
- Ticket is created automatically in the Hybris Jira system
- The tickets are being reviewed by the YaaS support engineers and are being assigned to the responsible teams if necessary.

IMPORTANT:
Specifically for these tickets we have additional features:
- Comments in the Jira tickets are automatically copied into an email and sent to the customer (reporter of the inquiry)
- Customers (reporter of the inquiry) can reply to these mails – text from these replies are automatically added to the corresponding Jira ticket

Responsibilities of the teams
- All teams are responsible for the relevant tickets for their services and have to work on these tickets according to the internal SLOs that are valid for all teams (please see table below).
- The tool for these ticket is Hybris Jira
- React to blockers and critical issues reported by customers and other teams as soon as possible. In case of JIRA tickets with priority blocker, create an action plan, communicate information on the expected resolution time to the reporter.
- Work according to the internal SLOs

### Service Level Objectives (SLO’s) and working hours

In the customer assistance model we have SLAs towards the customer concerning the availability of the services.
Any other inquiries have to be worked on in accordance to the internal SLOs:
