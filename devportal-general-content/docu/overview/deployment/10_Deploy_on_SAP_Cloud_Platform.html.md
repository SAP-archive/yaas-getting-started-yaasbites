title: 'Deploy on SAP Cloud Platform'
---

YaaS Market is a marketplace for services. You can deploy the services that you get here on any deployment platform that you want.

SAP recommends **SAP Cloud Platform** as a platform-as-a-service solution. It provides two environments:

* **Cloud Foundry** for developing microservices-based applications, services and applications using non-Java runtimes, and IoT and machine learning scenarios.
* **Neo** for developing HTML5 and complex Java applications.

The **SAP Cloud Platform** free trial includes both environments. You can start with a trial account directly from the [SAP Cloud Platform Cockpit](https://account.hanatrial.ondemand.com/#/home/welcome).
