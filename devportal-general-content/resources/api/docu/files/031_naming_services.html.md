Service names are in lowercase, alphanumeric characters, with a maximum of 16 characters. The service name becomes part of the URL, such as `api.yaas.io/products`. Only the dash (-) special character is accepted, and it is used to separate implementations of the same interface or APIs of the same type, such as **tax-avalara**. The standard, out-of-the-box implementation is the simple name, such as **tax**.
