The goal to develop and maintain services in Yaas is to develop them in a consistent and concise way following these **API Development Guidelines**. The YaaS team at SAP Hybris has figured out the best way to develop services, and shares this knowledge with you through these guidelines. In some cases, the guidelines are mandatory, while others are optional.

Also, follow the [API Guidelines](/tools/apiguidelines). For instance, always use the API response codes and error message payloads defined in that documentation.
