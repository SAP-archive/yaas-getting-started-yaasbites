title: API Versioning
---

Every exposed API must have a version, which is just a MAJOR number, such as v1. This ensures changes won't automatically break the product with every update, and users can decide when to upgrade to a newer version of the code. When the new version breaks API compatibility, you must increase the version number, such as v2.

The MAJOR API versions are used for all the [Release Notes](/rn/).
