The goal to develop and maintain services in Yaas is to develop them in a consistent and concise way following these **API Development Guidelines**. In some cases, the guidelines are mandatory, while others are optional.

Make sure to read the [External Development Guidelines](/tools/developmentguidelines/index.html) and follow the [API Guidelines](/tools/apiguidelines). For instance, always use the API response codes and error message payloads defined in that documentation..
