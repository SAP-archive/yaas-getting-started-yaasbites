title: Event Schemas
---

All Events sent using the [PubSub](/services/pubsub/latest/index.html) service are linked with a formalized schema definition. Since service versions are constantly changing, as are event structures, you must provide these event schemas to ensure users can consume your events properly. See the documentation guidelines on [Events](https://devportal.yaas.io/internal/tools/documentationsdk/index.html#events-document).
