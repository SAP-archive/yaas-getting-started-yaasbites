title: Operating Procedures
---

Each team is responsible for defining the procedure for operating the service's components. The operational procedure guide contains information about the environment setup, specific setup, and dependencies, such as if a backing service is used. It should also include a list of operational tasks so an on-call person can try to solve a problem, such as restarting the system, or other operations based on experiences working with the services.
