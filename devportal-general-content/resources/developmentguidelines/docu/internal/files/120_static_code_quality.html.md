title: Static Code Quality Checks
---

It is recommended for each team to integrate tools that provide [static code analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tools_for_static_code_analysis) for each programming language if available, such as Java, Groovy, or JavaScript. These static code checks are run on a regular basis. Reports and analysis on code are used for quality decision gate points, and identifies the possible source of errors. The static code quality checks promote quality code engineering and structuring practices.
