There are some things you need to consider before you create your package.

Please read the following and take the necessary steps to ensure that you fulfill these requirements.

#### Guidelines

* If you intend to sell your package using another sales channel, such as SAP Digital, please first consult our e-commerce manager, <a href="mailto:martin.gurney@sap.com">Martin Gurney</a>.
* Ensure that the package you develop meets the country-specific, legal criteria for the YaaS Market. For more information, see the Legal Framework section.
* Ensure that we, SAP, have the commercial rights to the media you intend to use to advertise your package (videos, pictures, screenshots, and so on).
* Document all of the services that are included in your package - these are legally required as they form part of the subscription contract, and are the basis of your SLAs. Follow these <a href="https://devportal.yaas.io/internal/tools/documentationsdk/">guidelines</a> and contact <a href=mailto:team-flyspeck@sap.com>Team Flyspeck</a> at least 4 weeks before you wish to go live with your product.
* Fill out the *Revenue Classification* questionnaire. For more information, contact <a href="mailto:martin.gurney@sap.com">Martin Gurney</a>.
