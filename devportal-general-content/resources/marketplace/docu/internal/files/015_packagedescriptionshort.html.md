title: 'Package Short Description'
type: 'Get Your Package Approved'
---
This is the short description of the purpose of your package. It is displayed beside the package icon on your product detail page (PDP). It is also visible when a customer clicks *Quick View* on your package tile in the YaaS Market.

Remember, this sentence is the first point of contact with your potential customers. It must be short enough to be easily read, and have enough content to create an interest to click for more information.

#### Guidelines

* Enter a short sentence that concisely explains what your package can do.
* It should contain the package name in **bold**.
* The maximum length for the description is 140 characters, including formatting.
* If your description needs to be translated for another market, bear in mind that most translations require more characters than the original text, so keep your description as short as possible.
