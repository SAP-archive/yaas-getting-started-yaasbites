title: 'Package Long Description'
type: 'Get Your Package Approved'
---
Explain why someone should subscribe to your package.

### Introduction
#### What does your package do?
Start with an introductory sentence, but do not simply repeat the short description. Also, do not make promises that you cannot keep, such as telling your customers their profits will increase, or that customer loyalty will be guaranteed if they subscribe to your package.

Example:

Encourage customer loyalty and promote revenue growth by embedding promotional coupons into your offer.

### Features and Benefits
#### What are the main features and benefits of your package?
List the reasons why your package will benefit customers.
Introduce this list by saying *You can*, *The (your package name) can*, *Use (your package name)
to*, and so on.
* Start each sentence in the list with a verb and a capital letter.
* End each sentence with a period (full stop).
* Use simple language.
* Keep your sentences short.
* If you refer to other products in your description, use the appropriate product trademarks.

To ensure that your potential customers will read about these benefits, we recommend a minimum of three features and a maximum of eight.

### API Documentation
#### Link to your service documentation
All services that included in your package must be documented - this is mandatory. The service documentation allows customers who have more technical expertise to understand what you are selling.
If possible, link to the *Overview* of your package documentation in the API Docs on the Dev Portal.
If you do not have an overview section, simply set a link to the API Docs at http://devportal.yaas.io/services.
