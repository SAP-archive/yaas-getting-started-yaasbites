title: 'Include Your Builder Modules'
type: 'Get Your Package Approved'

A *Builder Module* is a user interface where a business user can manage the services of your package.

#### Guidelines

Builder modules are not mandatory, but if your services have such a user interface to manage entities and flows, then it must be available in the Builder and not a different tool.

The one exception to this is if your service is part of a cross-tenant functionality. For example, if you have to work with all of your tenants in one view.

* Builder modules must follow the <a href="https://techne.yaas.io/Guidelines.html">Techné design guidelines</a>. If you need a new component, talk to us and we will work on it with you.
* Navigation principles, such as back buttons and paging, must follow the standards that we have in the Core Builder. Most are documented in Techné, otherwise, follow the standards in the Core Builder.
* Terminology and texts must be consistent with those in the Core Builder - check out the buttons, labels, and messages that are there.
* Translations of your texts must also be consistent with those in the Core Builder - so please test them and compare with the Core Builder when you have a new language version.
* Your builder module should be easy to use and understand. That means it should not require documentation. Provide help texts that are available directly on the screen instead, or guided tours (see our <a href="https://devportal.yaas.io/tools/buildersdk/index.html">Builder SDK</a>). If you need assistance, talk to one of our Techné experts, <a href="mailto:jose.enrique.gonzalez.modecir@sap.com">Jose Enrique Gonzalez Modecir</a>.

For more complex flows or concepts, refer the user to our guides in the <a href="https://knowledge.yaas.io/">Knowledge Hub</a>.
