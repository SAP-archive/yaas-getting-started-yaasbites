Before your package can be approved, it needs to pass the RTC (Release To Customer) and RTO (Release to OOEM)

* YaaS Teams: Follow the YaaS Cycle

#### Guidelines

The Release To Customer (RTC) and Release To OOEM (RTO) must be documented in Sirius. Contact your program lead if you need more information.

#### Release To OOEM (Outbound Original Equipment Manager)
Products offered through the Outbound OEM channel must fulfil higher standards than those offered through non-OOEM channels. This includes additional checks for product standards, and the package must be certified as “OEM ready” during validation.

All OOEM software must also go through an additional RTO Release Decision (Release to OOEM).

Software will not be released for the OOEM channel without successfully passing the RTO Release Decision.
