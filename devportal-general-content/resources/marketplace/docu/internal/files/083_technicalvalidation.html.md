The package must pass a technical validation.

#### Guidelines

Follow the <a href="/tools/apiguidelines">API Guidelines</a> that are in the Dev Portal.

All UIs in the Builder must follow the <a href="https://techne.yaas.io">Techné</a> guidelines. Techné is the design guideline and component library for modern, mobile-first, user-centric experience design on YaaS. It gives user experience professionals the freedom and creativity to implement experiences from design to deployment quickly.

In order to speed up the technical validation, please contact <a href="mailto:andrea.stubbe@sap.com">Andrea Stubbe</a> at least two weeks before you want to publish your package.

Remember:
* Packages that violate the API and UI guidelines will not be published.
* All management and administrative user interfaces must be Builder modules. Exceptions can be granted - contact <a href="mailto:andrea.stubbe@sap.com">Andrea Stubbe</a>.
* Packages that put the stability of YaaS at risk will not be approved. For example, a package that creates unreasonably high peak load, or a package that poses a security risk.
