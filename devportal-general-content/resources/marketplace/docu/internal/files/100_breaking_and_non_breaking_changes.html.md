The difference between breaking and non-breaking changes.

#### Guidelines

As a package owner, you want to make sure that your subscribers get the latest (and greatest!) features that you have to offer.

So, when can you instantly update your package?

And, when do your subscribers have to update to a new package version?

### Non-Breaking Changes

You can instantly update your package if your changes do not affect the existing functionality of the package, or do not negatively impact your subscribers. These are “non-breaking” changes.

Examples of non-breaking changes:
* Improvements to the package and new cool features that don’t require any action by your subscribers.
* Corrections to your package description or uploading new media to advertise your package.
* Adding your package to a new market.

However, don’t forget to document any new cool features by writing a release note.

### Breaking Changes
#### So what’s a breaking change?

Any change that requires your subscribers to implement something new, change the way they use the package, or accept new terms and conditions is considered a breaking change.

You must inform your subscribers about a new package version if you:
* Modify the package functionality in such a way that the subscriber can no longer use it as before.
* Change the additional terms of use for a package.
* Delete a service or a builder module.
* Create a new version of one or more services within your package.
* Alter the rate plan for your package.
* Change permissions to other services.

Informing your subscribers is easy. Make your changes and when you publish, simply select the checkbox to terminate the current version, and then fill out the email template.

Keep the email simple – a short list of benefits or improvements will suffice. You can describe everything in detail in your release note, which you will also link in the email.

Remember, you must give your subscribers at least 3 months to update to your newest version.

### Beta to Commercial
#### What if I have an approved Beta package, and want to publish a Commercial version of this package?

In this case, the package must be sent for approval again to the e-commerce manager. You need a material number for your package if you want to sell it on a commercial market - the e-commerce manager will organize this for you.
