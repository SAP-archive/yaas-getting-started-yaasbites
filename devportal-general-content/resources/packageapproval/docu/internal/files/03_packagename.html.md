#### Description

This is the name that will be displayed on the YaaS Market.

#### Guidelines

Use the following guidelines for naming your package:

* Give your package a short, meaningful name that reflects the functionality of the service.
* Use a maximum of 28 characters, including spaces.
* Ensure that package names do not violate copyright or trademark rights of other parties.
* Avoid names or characteristics that refer to YaaS, such as *Your Package Name for YaaS* or *Your Package Name, Cloud Version*.
* Do not incorporate names of existing products in your package name, especially if these are sold outside of the YaaS Market (for example, SAP Hybris Marketing Loyalty).
* If it is a Beta product, you must include the word Beta in brackets after the name, for example Cart (Beta).
