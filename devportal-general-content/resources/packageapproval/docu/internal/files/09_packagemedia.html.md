#### Description

Screenshots are the first impressions of your product. Good quality images that accurately depict your product can help you gain more customers. Provide a series of screenshots that show how your package works.

#### Guidelines

The following guidelines apply to screenshots that you upload in the Builder:
* The maximum width for screenshots is 800 pixels.
* The total file size for all images must not exceed 2 MB. For example, you can upload 10 images that are 200 KB each for a total file size of 2 MB.
* All images and icons should be in <code>.png</code> format. Do not use interlaced <code>.png</code> files.
* The standard bit depth for icons and images is 24 bits (8 bits each for red, green, and blue) plus an 8-bit alpha channel, for a total of 32 bits.
* The palette does not need to be limited to web-safe colors.
* Ensure that we, SAP, have the commercial rights to any media that you upload to advertise your package!

Please be creative and avoid using images of the API console.

Remember, if your screenshots do not follow these standards, your package will not be approved for the YaaS Market.
