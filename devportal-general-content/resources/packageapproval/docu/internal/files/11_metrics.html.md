#### Description

A metric is a unit that defines what is being measured. The metrics form the basis of the rate plan, which determines how customers are billed for commercial packages, and what usage limits are set in non-commercial (Beta) packages.

#### Guidelines

You can select any metric that is on the current YaaS metric list (see below).

**API Calls** is the simplest metric that can be used and the easiest one to get approved.

* **API Call Read**: One call to an API to retrieve data from the respective service called
* **API Call Write**: One call to write or modify data in the respective service called


**Products** – A product is a single entity representing a finished good, service, or solution with a respective specification of its features and or characteristics within the context of the cloud service.

<div class="panel note">If the definition of the metrics do not meet your requirements, or you need an additional metric, please contact <a href=mailto:martin.gurney@sap.com>Martin Gurney</a>.
Metrics must be simple and easily understood by the target audience. They must also scale with usage and delivery costs. Because of this, each metric must be approved by our legal team, and this approval may take considerable time.</div>
