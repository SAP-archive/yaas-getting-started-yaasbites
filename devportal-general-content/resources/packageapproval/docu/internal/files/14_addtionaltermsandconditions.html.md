title: Additional Terms for your Package
---

#### Description

The current Framework Agreements (see Legal Framework) are the standard terms and conditions that are valid for your package when you publish to the YaaS Market.

If there are any deviations to these with regard to your package, then these must be added so that they are displayed on the YaaS Market under *Additional Terms* on your product detail page.

#### Guidelines

* Additional terms for your package must first be verified by our legal team. Please send an email, well in advance of the publishing date, to <a href=mailto:christian.hoffmann@sap.com>Christian Hoffmann</a> and <a href=mailto:martin.gurney@sap.com>Martin Gurney</a> on how to proceed.
* Additional terms of use are country-specific. They must be reviewed by the legal team for each market. This means that terms that have been approved for the U.S. market may not be legally valid for Germany, UK, or any other market, so please get them checked.
* Bear in mind that additional terms for other countries will probably have to be translated into the official language of that market. Please ensure you do this in good time. For more details, see the Globalization Checklist.
