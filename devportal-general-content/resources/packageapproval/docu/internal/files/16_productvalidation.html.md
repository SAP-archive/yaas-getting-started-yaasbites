title: Product Validation
---
#### Description

Release to Customer (RTC) and Release to (RTO) passed the Simplified Cloud Cycle process.

#### Guidelines

Work with your Program Manager. The result is a link to Sirius.

#### RTO
Products offered through the Outbound OEM channel require the fulfillment of additional standards than “regular” software. This includes additional checks for product standards and a certification as “OEM ready” during validation. Furthermore, all OOEM software needs to go through an additional RTO Release Decision (Release to OOEM). In the future, software will not be released for the OOEM channel without successfully passing the RTO Release Decision.
